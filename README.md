### About Me

I'm a software developer building software products customized to client needs. My journey in software development started in 2016 while pursuing a degree in Computer Science, where I started learning programming with Java. In 2019, during my internship, I was introduced to Elixir—a programming language that has significantly influenced my career.

With a strong foundation in test-driven development, agile methodologies, and software architecture, I prioritize code quality, scalability, and client delivery in every project I work on.

👥 Community Engagement:

I'm a supporter of developers' community growth. I'm privileged that I had the opportunity to be part of an organizing team at ElixirKenya and ElixirConfAfrica, where I helped coordinate the Elixir webinar sessions, which bring the community together to learn and network with different people around the world.

What fascinates me most in my field as someone always ready to learn and be a team player striving to bring positive change toward the success of an organization is the fact that we can transform great ideas and challenging problems into functional products that have a real impact on our day-to-day activities.

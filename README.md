### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tracey Onim and I'm a software developer. My software journey started around 2012 when I was in university studying computer science.
I started learning programming with Java for my 3rd and 4th year projects.

2019 during my internship period, I was introduced to Elixir and started enjoying every bit of my programming journey. With skills and knowledge gained every day by programming with Elixir, I'm able to share them through writing technical blogs, you can find my blogs on the following platforms
  
- In medium(https://medium.com/@traceyonim22)
- In Elixir school(https://elixirschool.com/blog/components-with-dynamic-attributes)
- In Appsignal(https://blog.appsignal.com/authors/tracey-onim.html)

Recently opened a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Elixir.code_girl/videos) covering Elixir-related topics of what I'm learning. Sharing is caring plus this allows me to be able to learn and grow in my field.

I have specialized in building software products customized to client needs with in-depth knowledge of test-driven, agile software methodology and prioritizing various aspects such as development, architecture, code quality, and delivery to clients.

Currently, I'm working on a system providing cryptocurrency payment solutions. I have taken part in designing and implementing payment flows following the CQRS pattern.

I'm also a supporter of developers' community growth. I'm privileged  that I had the opportunity to be part of an organizing team at ElixirKenya and ElixirConfAfrica where I helped coordinate the Elixir webinar sessions which bring the community together to learn and network with different people around the world. I'm also privileged to participate as a speaker in the ElixirKenya webinar, the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ-ZRP5FKZ8&t=421s) is available on the ElixirKenya Youtube channel.

What fascinates me most in my field as someone always ready to learn and be a team player striving to bring positive change toward the success of an organization is the fact that we can transform great ideas and challenging problems into functional products that have a real impact on our day-to-day activities.
